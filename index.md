## Research

- ***Almost $\iota$-complexes as immersed curves with Professor Zemke at Princeton:*** *(2020)* 
  I provided a new classification of almost $\iota$-complexes, and an algorithm to compute the product operation and local equivalence class representative of an almost $\iota$-complex. I hope to classify the homomorphisms to $\Z$ as well.
- ***Borel graphs and smooth game equilibria with Professor Kechris at Caltech:*** *(2019)*
  I studied equilibria of incomplete information games and the Cantor Bernstein theorem for Borel graphs using countable Borel equivalence relations. 
- ***Knot sliceness and computing $HFK^-$ with Professor Ni at Caltech:*** *(2018)* 
  I studied the sliceness of cablings of the figure eight knot and computed $HFK^-$ for knots with up to 10 crossings.

  I am the head TA for Ma 0, a summer course for all incoming freshman at Caltech, preparing them for proof based calculus. I hold weekly office hours, grade papers, and post notes. 
- ***Caltech Ma 1 Dean's tutor:***
  I held weekly office hours and helped with homework in calculus, linear algebra, and differential geometry.
- ***Walter Reed Middle School MATHCOUNTS coach:***
  MATHCOUNTS is a nation-wide math competition for middle-schoolers.
