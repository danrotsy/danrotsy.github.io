## Research

- ***Almost $\iota$-complexes as immersed curves with Professor Zemke at Princeton:*** *(2020)* 
  Using the Fukaya category of the twice punctured disk, we provided a new classification of almost $\iota$-complexes, and defined a new homomorphism from the homology cobordism group. 
- ***Borel graphs and smooth game equilibria with Professor Kechris at Caltech:*** *(2019)*
  We studied equilibria of incomplete information games and the Cantor Bernstein theorem for Borel graphs using countable Borel equivalence relations. 
- ***Knot sliceness and computing $HFK^-$ with Professor Ni at Caltech:*** *(2018)* 
  We studied the sliceness of cablings of the figure eight knot and computed $HFK^-$ for knots with up to 10 crossings.
